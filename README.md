# Capstone Project

### Online store idea

Have a app like ebay where people can buy and sell items.

Have users be able to sell and purchase items from other people\
Users are able to list a item to be sold at a price of their choosing\
Users are able to purchase any item they see on the website\
Users each have a shopping cart that would reserve the item in the cart for a period of time\
Users are able to search items using a search bar\
Users can filter items by category, price, etc.\
Users sign-in to their own account\
Once orders users will get a order number and the item will appear in theier purchase history

Would use ReactJS, HTML, CSS or maybe even Flutter for this project\
If using a sql database I would use PostgreSQL with Express.js, Sequelize to manage the database\
FirebaseAuth for authentication, and maybe firestore for nosql
