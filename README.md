# Capstone Project

###Online store idea

Have users be able to sell and purchase items from other people 

Users are able to list a item to be sold at a price of their choosing
Users are able to purchase any item they see on the website
Users each have a shopping cart that would reserve the item in the cart for a period of time
Users are able to search items using a search bar
Users can filter items by category, price, etc.
Users sign-in to their own account
Once orders users will get a order number and the item will appear in theier purchase history

Would use ReactJS or maybe even Flutter for this project
If using a sql database I would use Sequelize to manage the database
use firebase for auth and maybe firestore
